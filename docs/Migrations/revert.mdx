# Revert to Legacy
In a case of a migration have issues. We need to revert back to the original setup.(Docker)

1. Stop **pm2** process and stop daemon.
  ```
  $ pm2 stop all
  $ pm2 delete all
  & pm2 save
  ```
2. Restore the `old.client` to `client`. From root,
  ```
  mv old.client client
  ```
3. Restore **Cron Jobs**.
  ```
  crontab -e
  ```
  * Uncomment the commented line.
  * change `old.client` to `client`.
4. Wipe the users in devices.
5. Refresh AWS login.
  ```
  aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | docker login --
  username AWS --password-stdin 312466207882.dkr.ecr.ap-south-
  1.amazonaws.com
  ```
6. Go to `client` directory.
7. Start the docker container.
  ```
  docker-compose start -d
  ```
8. Monitor logs for successfull sync.
  ```
  logs
  ```
9. Check the device's user count.
