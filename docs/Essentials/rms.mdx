# RMS
Teltonika RMS (Remote Management System) is a cloud-based platform developed by Teltonika Networks that allows you to remotely monitor, manage, and configure Teltonika networking devices such as routers and gateways.  

## Adding a Router to the RPI
1. Client will send you a router pic.  
   ![Teltonica Router](/images/client.router.png)  
2. keep these details. (Notepad)  
   Testing this to extract text [editpad.org](https://www.editpad.org/tool/extract-text-from-image)  
   * `SERIAL`, `MAC`,  
   * `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD` - This is router hardware password.  
   * `WIFI PASSWORD` - SSID password.  
3. Login to go to the related RMS account (based on region).  
4. Search `SERIAL` in devices section to check wheather used one or not. <span style={{ color: "red" }}>It's recommend to check on both regions because some systems are moved   from one region to another.</span>  
5. In "Devices" section, Go to `Add`,  
   ![RMS Add Devices](/images/rms.adddevice.png)  
   `Name` - "client-site" ex:- *Duro - Wilberforce Court*  
   `Serial number` - `SERIAL` from the router. ex: *6000643772*  
   `LAN MAC Address` - `LAN MAC` from the router. ex: *2097270EC681*  
   `Password` - Router password. ex: *n1BOWfi9*  
6. To active `Manage service`  
   `Devices` >> `Verify device` then enter the `PASSWORD` (router password).  
7. If the router is not online after few minutes. Contact client to restart the router.

## Configuring Settings
1. After router online, Go to `Web UI`.

2. Login using router `USERNAME` (admin), `PASSWORD` to **Web UI**. When You Login to the device first time. You need to set up new password.  
    `username` : `admin`  
    `password`:  `Igs@i360.lk`  
3.  If there is a **Firmware Update** perform it before proceeding. You need to log again after update.

4.  Go to `Network` >> `Mobile` >> `SIM Switch`. Configure each **SIM**.  
    * **SIM 1**  
      *   `Check interval`: `300`  
      *   `No network`: `True`  
      *   `On network denied`: `True`  
      *   `On data connection fail`: `True`  
  
    * **SIM 2**  
      * `Check interval`: `300`  
      * `No network`: `True`  
      * `On network denied`: `True`  
      * `On data connection fail`: `True`  
      * `Switch to next SIM after delay`: `True`  
      * `Initial delay(min)`: `60`  
  
    Save and Apply the settings. Then **Enable** SIM in the table.

5.  `Network` >> `LAN`. Check these settings.    
    `IPv4 address`: `192.168.1.1`   
    `Ipv4 netmask`: `255.255.255.0`   
    `Use WAN port as LAN`: `True`  
    `Enable DHCPv4`: `True`   
    `Enable DHCPv6`: `True`  
    Save and Apply.

6.  Go to `Network` >> `Wireless` >> `SSIDs`. Check these settings   
    Under the "general setup"  
    `Passwoard`: `Irongate@123`
7.  Exit the **Web UI**. Go to `Ports`.  
    ![RMS Ports](/images/rms.ports.png)  
    Add the device (ex: *192.168.1.150 is a RPI*)  
    `Name`: Device name (ex: *RPI*)  
    `Protocol`: `SSH`  
    `Port`: `22`   
8.  Go to `Remote Access` >> Connect to RPI.
