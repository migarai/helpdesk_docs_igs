# RPI Issues

## Docker Not-Responding. 
When you entered a command related to docker (`docker-compose`, `logs`) and it didn't respond or returns a related error, means that there is an issue with **Docker service** or **Docker Containers**. 

1. Restart the **Docker Service**.
   ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```
2. Close the current docker session.
   ```bash
    docker-compose down
   ```
3. Start the containers.
   ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
   ```

 This will resync the devices again.
