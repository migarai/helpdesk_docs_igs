# RPI Issues

## Docker Not-Responding.
When you entered a command related to docker (`docker-compose`, `logs`) and it didn't respond or returns a related error, means that there is an issue with **Docker service** or **Docker Containers**.

1. Restart the **Docker Service**.
   ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```
2. Close the current docker session.
   ```bash
    docker-compose down
   ```
3. Start the containers.
   ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
   ```

:::note
 This will resync the devices again.

## Tracking Client (RPI) not Recognising Readers
  This could be identify by program not showing any logs about raders even though user data is being pushed. It is happening because the pairs (FR pairs) not updated correctly in the database. **To fix this try updating the pairs in gates again.**
